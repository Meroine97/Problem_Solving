# Problem_Solving

## Solving Problems it's a skill that every Programmer should have, at least must slove more than 2000 Problems.

## Some Advice:

1: You have to Know that, Programming language it not means Programming it just a tools used to solve problems (Dependent the Problem that you have.)
Programming it Logic, the way you think, analysis, ability to find the best solution...

2: Take your time about thinking on problem before you write Code.

3: Do not Start with the newest technologies, on the contrary start with low level languages to know more about how things works in right way like C/C++, Java
because if you start with high level languages have a lot of built-in function ready and you will be weak in opposite if you start with C++ example you have to build lot of function to use it in your Project ... 
this is the best platform to start from Zero to be good at Programming ##ProgrammingAdvices
