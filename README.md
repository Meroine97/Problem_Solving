# Problem_Solving
> [!IMPORTANT]
> # Solving problems is a skill that every programmer should have. A good programmer should solve at least 2,000 problems.
## Some Advice:
`1: Understand the difference between programming languages and programming itself:`  
A programming language is just a tool used to solve problems (depending on the problem you have).
Programming is about logic—the way you think, analyze, and find the best solution.

`2: Think before you code:`  
Take your time to analyze a problem before writing any code.

`3: Start with low-level languages:`  
Do not begin with the newest technologies. Instead, start with low-level languages like C/C++ or Java to better understand how things work.
High-level languages have many built-in functions, which can make you dependent on them.
If you start with C++, for example, you’ll have to build many functions yourself, strengthening your problem-solving skills.

`4: A great platform to start from zero and become proficient in programming is ProgrammingAdvices.`

`5: Avoid negativity and stay focused:`  
Do not waste time with negative people. Focus on your goals and self-improvement.
